            <h2>What is WaniKani?</h2>
            <p>WaniKani is a website that uses Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) and unique mnemonics 
            to help users learn both the meanings and readings of Japanese characters and vocabulary. It works by reducing
            components to their smallest part to help users build meaningful context that helps stimulate memory.</p>
            <h2>So what is this website for?</h2>
            <p>WaniKani strongly enforces its strict Spaced Repetion schedule, meaning users can only take reviews on specific items when
            they are ready in the queue. <strong>This is a good thing</strong> &mdash; if you were
            to quiz yourself each day on the meaning of ç™½, you will never get the chance to stretch your memory and test it out at
            30 days.</p>
            <p>But some users, like myself, have to take extended breaks, and when we come back, we are overwhelmed with hundreds of items in
            our queue from several months&mdash;or years&mdash;ago. Or sometimes users would like a refresher on the items already burned.
            Thus, I built this app as a simple supplement to WaniKani.</p>
            <p>Please note, for the above reason, this app should be used <strong>sparingly</strong>. WaniKani makes you wait those 30 days
            for a good reason, and by overtaking quizzes, you could undermine your own progress!</p>
